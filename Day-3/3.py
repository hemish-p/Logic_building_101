'''
Write a program where the user enters two integers (divisor and dividend) and calculates their quotient and remainder. For example:

Input: Dividend: 22, Divisor: 7
Output:
Quotient: 3
Remainder: 1
'''
Divident=22
Divisor = 7

Quotient=Divident//Divisor
remainder=Divident%Divisor

print("Quotient: ",Quotient)
print("Remainder: ",remainder)
